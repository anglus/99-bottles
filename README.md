# 99 Bottles 

A collection of programs that output the lyrics to the song "99 Bottles of Beer", as defined in the file "bottle.txt". Numerous examples of such programs may be found at the <a href="http://99-bottles-of-beer.net/">99 Bottles of Beer</a> Web site, but the site appears to no longer be maintained. My principal objective is not to add variations to the programming languages already found there, but to produce examples in programming languages that are not found there, because they are either relatively new or obscure, preferably both.

As with the Fizzbuzz project, my goal is for each program to be (in descending order of priority):

	1. Correct
	2. Safe
	3. Readable 
	4. Idiomatic 

Unlike the maintainers of the 99 Bottles of Beer Web site, I don't hold idiomatic code (and code that uses special features of the particular language) as my highest priority. Nevertheless, I do welcome improvements to any of the programs, especially those that help me achieve the above goals. However, I am not inclined to make changes that further a lesser goal at the expense of a higher goal.

Below is a list of languages for which a 99 Bottles program exists in this collection:

- Crystal (added August 24, 2016)
- Julia (added August 24, 2016)
